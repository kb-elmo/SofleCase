### --> [Original Sofle v2 keyboard repository](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard)

You can find multiple different PCB variants over there.  
Please note that only the v2 layout versions are compatible with this case.

#### Assembly materials needed:

- 10x m2x10mm screws for the cases
- 8x m2x6mm screws for the plates
- 8x 6mm rubber bumpons (optional)


#### Please note:  

- This case was designed to be used with the Elite-C or Puchi-C controller!  
The USB connector holes in the back of the case would not work properly with a standard ProMicro.
- The two case halves are not symmetrical!  
Just using one of the files and mirroring it in your slicer will not work.  
The holes for the TRRS cable are in slightly different locations on the two sides.
- The reset switch on both sides of the board should ideally be mounted on the bottom of the PCB.  
That way you can press the button through the hole in the bottom of the case without having to disassemble the entire board.
- The included knob is designed for the Alps EC11E15244G1 encoder.  
If you are using a different model you might have to use a different knob for your board.
- The cutouts in the bottom pieces are meant for RGB strips.  
If you print the bottoms out of a clear filament you will get a very nice and even underglow effect.  
(as shown in the picture above) 


#### Special Thanks to 

- Josef Adamcik for designing the original Sofle v2 Keyboard and making the project open source
- the "komische Tastaturen" gang of the german keyboard community that pushed me into making this

### These files are meant for 3D printing only! 

They are not suitable for CNC machining and trying to use them for that will most likely result in unusable parts.
